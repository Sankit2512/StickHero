Introduction
For our AP course project, we implemented a game inspired by Stick Hero using JavaFX and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts. Our game emulates the core mechanics of Stick Hero while adding our own creative twist. This document provides an overview of our project.

Game Summary
In this project, we developed a game where a character named Stick Hero traverses between platforms by stretching out a stick. The stick has to be of the exact length, or the character will fall. The character can collect rewards (cherries) while reaching the goal. Our objective was to create an engaging game that follows these core principles.

Game Mechanics
Character Control: Players control a character named Stick Hero who moves between platforms by extending a stick to bridge gaps.
Variable Platform Widths: We included multiple pillars of different widths.
Reviving Feature: We implemented a feature that allows the player to be revived once using a certain amount of cherries collected during the game. The cherries and related score are deducted upon revival.
Timing: Players need to time the stick extension correctly to land on the next platform. Failing to land on a platform results in the character falling, ending the game.
Rewards: The character collects rewards, such as cherries, by flipping the player upside down using user input while traversing platforms. These rewards add to the player's score.
Scoring System: We implemented a scoring system that encourages players to achieve higher scores by collecting more rewards.
Progress Saving: We included an option for players to save their progress (last score, highest score, total cherries) at any point during gameplay.
Graphics and Sound: Our game features graphics, sound effects, and animations to enhance the overall gaming experience.
Important Instructions
We adhered to all deadlines as specified.
We maintained a private Git repository for our project. Each group member frequently committed their code to this repository. Plagiarism was not tolerated; we kept our repository private.
We followed good programming practices to avoid penalties.
Evaluation was Maven-based. We ensured our pom.xml file worked.
We included JUnit tests in our submission.
We used at least two design patterns and annotated where they are used in the code.
We used as many OOP principles as possible.
We used only the JavaFX library.
